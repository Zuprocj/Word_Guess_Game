# Word_Guess_Game

Created a word guessing game according to the hw requirements.  I was struggling with making the javasciprt work. Most of the mistakes were camelcase and updating the html document with the javascript updates.  Changed the variables and the html id's to match in order to link them easier.  I had an idea for the game win screen but was unable to execute it.  
My idea was as the the user guesses each word correctly an image would fill in ending with a complete image of a breakfast.  However, I couldn't figure out how to reduce the word choice array as the user keeps guessing.
